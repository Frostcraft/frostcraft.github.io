<h1>Rules</h1>
Our rules are pretty simple, and you’ll find similar ones across most other communities. Basically, it comes down to not cheating and not harassing players.
<br/>
<br/>
Client Modifications – We ask that you do not modify your client to gain an unfair advantage over other players. This includes things such as no-fall, auto-hit, x-ray, auto-sprint, fly, speed, automated bots, etc. Modifications which only affect visual aspects of the game, such as Optifine and Mini-Map are fine provided that you do not use them to gain unfair advantages (such as using the player head feature in mini-map to see invisible players).
